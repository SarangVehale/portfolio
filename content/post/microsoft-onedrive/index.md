# How to stop Microsoft OneDrive to stop bugging up your system

So.. Today by encounter whilst I was trying to get a little bit work done on windows, OneDrive backup kicked and fucked up all my files.

I found a workaround for it which is actually quite great

1. Uninstall OneDrive (duh...)
2. Another option that you can do is
   Go to :
   `bash
Settings -> Apps -> Resume -> Toggle OneDrive On/Off 
`
   This worked decently good enough and is decently hidden.

Go ahead stroke yourself to find this !! Cheers
