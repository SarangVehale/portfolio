## Cybersecurity & Quantum Computing Enthusiast / Professional Overthinker\*\*

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is not LinkedIn. This is not a résumé. This is where I stash the things I’ve done so I don’t forget them (and so you can’t pretend I didn’t do them).

I build algorithms, break them, and sometimes even put them back together in a way that makes sense. My natural habitat is somewhere between a command-line terminal and a caffeine dispenser.

If you’re looking for corporate-sanitized, HR-approved jargon, there’s a PDF for that. If you want the _actual_ version, you’re already here.
