_A.K.A. Things I did to earn money, experience, or just an interesting story for later._

## Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) – Research Intern (Quantum Shenanigans)

**Remote – Ongoing**

- Built quantum algorithms with homomorphic encryption because regular algorithms weren’t challenging enough.
- Conducted a survey on hybrid quantum algorithms & meta-heuristics (read: spent hours convincing myself it wasn’t sci-fi).
- Managed project schematics like a sysadmin juggling flaming chainsaws.

## Stanford Code in Place – Section Leader (Python Wrangler)

**Remote – Apr 2025 to May 2025**

- Taught humans how to talk to machines in Python.
- Used “Karel the Robot” — basically programming for toddlers, but surprisingly effective.
- Prevented at least 3 students from rage-quitting programming forever.

## National Cyber-Crime Research & Innovation Centre (NCR&IC), MHA – Security Researcher & Mentor

**Delhi – Dec 2024 to Mar 2025**

- Trained judicial officers & law enforcement in cybercrime tech they didn’t know they needed (now I think they didn't need it).
- Co-ordinated the Cyber Commandos program (yes, that’s actually what it’s called).
- Made large language models (LLMs) play nice with law enforcement needs.
- A heck load of side projects (Why?? Absolute crawling servers, no network, and a heck load of expectations)

## CDAC (again) – Research Intern

**Pune – May 2024 to Jul 2024**

- Designed hybrid quantum algorithms using Babai’s & Schnorr’s algorithms with QAOA.
- First-authored a paper on integer factorization with lattice-based quantum methods — basically math so intense it hurts.

---

## Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) – Research Intern

**Canberra, Australia – Apr 2024 to Jun 2024**

- Designed enhanced key distribution protocols with quantum cryptography.
- Built methodology for efficient algorithms for secure communication (because insecure communication is overrated).

---

## Bhoomi-Itech – Research Intern

**Delhi – May 2023 to Jul 2023**

- Set up CALDERA and MITRE ATT&CK labs for threat simulations.
- Ran coordinated incident response simulations without accidentally taking down the internet (success).

_**Fun fact:** Most of these projects involved explaining to non-technical people why “just use AI” isn’t a real solution._
