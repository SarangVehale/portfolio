_A.K.A. the formal paperwork proving I sat through lectures and occasionally learned things._

**Dual degree pursuit — Cyber Security (NFSU) + Data Science (IIT Madras)**  
Yes, both. Simultaneously. Because apparently sleep is optional.

## National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU), Delhi, India

**Degree:** B.Tech – M.Tech in Cyber Security  
**GPA:** 3.53  
**Expected completion:** May 2026  
**Location:** Delhi, India

**Relevant coursework**

- Assembly
- C / C++
- Digital Forensics
- Cyber Security
- AI & ML
- Network and Mobile Security

**Notes**

- Focused on the low-level stuff that makes security engineers either giddy or cry.
- Coursework mixes hardware-adjacent topics (Assembly) with applied defensive/forensic skills.

## Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT Madras), Chennai, India

**Degree:** B.S. in Data Science  
**GPA:** 2.93  
**Expected completion:** May 2027  
**Location:** Chennai, India

**Relevant coursework**

- Artificial Intelligence
- Calculus
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning

**Notes**

- Traditional data-science diet: math + models + many, many datasets.
- Practical focus on turning noisy real-world data into something your models don’t immediately regret.

## TL;DR (for the impatient recruiter)

- Dual-degree track across NFSU & IITM — doing security and data in parallel.
- Hands-on/low-level security from NFSU; theory + data engineering from IITM.
- Coursework intentionally selected to cover both “how to break things” and “how to make sense of what broke.”
