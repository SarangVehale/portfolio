## Comparative Analysis of Classical and Quantum-Inspired BHO and GWO for the Traveling Salesman Problem (Pre-print)

- Tried to solve TSP with nature-inspired optimization and quantum tricks.
- The short version: still hard.

---

## Survey of Integer Factorization using Lattice-Based Algorithms (Peer Review – Springer Nature, SN Computer Science)

- Deep dive into integer factorization.
- Because breaking big numbers into smaller ones is still a big deal in cryptography.

---

## Optimizing Quantum Teleportation Protocols via Convex Programming and Information-Theoretic Constraints (Pre-print)

- Worked on making quantum teleportation more efficient.
- Sadly, still can’t teleport coffee to my desk.

---

## Exact Diagonalization Solution to the Quantum Many-Body Hamiltonian Problem (Pre-print)

- A math-heavy way of saying “we solved a quantum physics headache.”
- Useful for physics, possibly useless for small talk.

---

## Book Chapter – From Qubits to Quantum Radar: A Comprehensive Exploration of Quantum Machine Learning (To be published, CRC Press)

- Co-authored a chapter on how quantum machine learning could, in theory, mess with radar systems.
- In practice: still waiting for the book release.
