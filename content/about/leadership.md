_A.K.A. the times I was somehow put in charge of other humans and things didn’t completely fall apart._

## National Cadet Corps (NCC, Indian Army) – Junior Under Officer

- Wore the uniform, gave the orders, kept 540 cadets in line.
- Managed planning, coordination, and execution for the **Army Attachment Camp** with the 5 Sikh Light Infantry unit.
- Learned that leadership is 10% strategy and 90% telling people to hydrate.

## All India Forensic Science Conference 2025 – Organizer, Co-ordinator & Liaison Officer

- Herded academics, officials, and techies into the same venue without incident.
- Coordinated across departments like a network switch in human form.
- Liasoned for Justice Kaushal Thakkar, and Dr. Proff Robert Green (I never understood the point of liason)

## IIT-Bombay – Mood India Campus Leader

- Pick up kids from my university and carry them to IIT Bombay for the event
- Balanced hype with actual logistics so people had both fun _and_ functioning microphones.

---

## Open Source Contributions

- Hacktoberfest, GSSOC, Linux Foundation, GNU — contributed fixes, features, and the occasional ranty commit message.
- Because some bugs deserve more than just a polite pull request.

---

## Volunteering

- **Robin Hood Green Army (NGO):** Environmental work — planting trees, clean-ups, the works.
- **U&I Foundation (NGO):** Teaching & mentoring — apparently I like explaining stuff to strangers.

---

## SBI Marathon – Runner-Up

- Yes, I run. No, not from deadlines.

---

## Contributor – Linux Foundation

- Helped keep the open-source dream alive.
- Learned that sometimes the hardest part isn’t coding — it’s consensus.

_**Note:** Leadership is just project management where your “tasks” have legs and opinions._
