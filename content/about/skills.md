_A.K.A. tools, languages, and things I use to keep life interesting (or at least bearable)._

---

## Technical

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C/C++ (3+ years), Rust, R, Bash, SQL (2+ years), Java, JavaScript.
- **Platforms & Tools:** Git, Linux (of course), Jira, Open Source contribution workflows.

---

## Human Languages

- English, Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, Japanese — in case debugging in English isn’t painful enough.

---

## Interests

- Open source (because paying for software feels weird).
- Quantum computing (because regular computing is too predictable).
- Running (mostly away from unrealistic deadlines).

---

\_**Note:** Yes, I know the difference between Java and JavaScript. No, they’re not related. And yes I hate them equally.

I might have more but I don't remember
